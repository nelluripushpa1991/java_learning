1. How do you find duplicate records in a table?

SELECT column1, column2, COUNT(*)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column1, column2
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

2. How would you retrieve the second-highest salary from an Employee table?

SELECT DISTINCT salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;
// The LIMIT specifies the maximum number of rows to return
// OFFSET specifies how many rows to skip before beginning to return rows

SELECT MAX(salary)
FROM employees
WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees);
